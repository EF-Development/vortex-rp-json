Additionally, a fresh fleet of new police vehicles has been added, each equipped with upgraded performance and advanced technology to support high-speed pursuits and tactical scenarios.\n\nA new evidence system has also been introduced, allowing officers to collect bullet casings, lift fingerprints, and scan entire crime scenes for forensic analysis. Collected evidence can then be reviewed and processed in the forensic lab, giving officers detailed insights and helping build stronger cases.",
