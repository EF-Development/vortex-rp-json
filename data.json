Officers can now access real-time call information, unit statuses, and GPS tracking directly through the MDT for faster response times.\n\nThis update also brings new tactical gear into the field, including helmet-mounted flashlights, night vision goggles for nighttime operations, and a compact under-door camera for safe room clearing and reconnaissance. Additionally, a fresh fleet of new police vehicles has been added, each equipped with upgraded performance and advanced technology to support high-speed pursuits and tactical scenarios.\n\nA new evidence system has also been introduced, allowing officers to collect bullet casings, lift fingerprints, and scan entire crime scenes for forensic analysis. Collected evidence can then be reviewed and processed in the forensic lab, giving officers detailed insights and helping build stronger cases.",
