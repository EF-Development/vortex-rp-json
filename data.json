Gang members build reputation through activities such as winning turfs, selling drugs, spraying graffiti, killing opposing gang members, and other criminal actions. <b>Reputation</b> grants access to various items in their respective guild shop. <br>\n<b>- Guild shops</b> with reputation integration are now live. Each guild has <b>unique items</b> available to the gangs under their umbrella. All items have a <b>gang member rank requirement</b>. <br>\n<b>- Added</b> a <b>dynamic event system</b> where a random safe is placed to crack and a graffiti zone is created to spray during turf events to get players moving around within zones. <br>\n<b>- Max of 2 active zones</b> at a time. <br>\n<b>- Added notifications</b> to alert all gangs when a zone is started. <br>\n<b>- Dynamic walls</b> now spawn around zones. <br>\n<b>- The retro graffiti system</b> is back, now updated with every gang’s logos. <br>\n<b>- New drug sale script:</b> no need to find peds anymore — they will now come to you while you’re standing on the block. <br>\n<b>- Uncontested zones</b> are now easier to build heat in to help progress toward starting a turf. <br>\n<b>- Contested zones</b> are now slightly harder to gain heat inside. <br>\n<b>- Added notifications</b> when heat is given. <br>\n<b>- Added notifications</b> when heat is full inside a turf. <br>\n<b>- Introduced a dynamic gang HUD</b> that updates based on the zone you're in. It displays: <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Current heat level</b> <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Whether the zone is contested or uncontested</b> <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Progress until full heat</b> <br>\n<b>- Reduced damage</b> dealt from outside the zone. Outside shooting is no longer a viable option — while it can still happen, the damage is reduced enough to push players to infiltrate instead. <br>\n\n<br>\n📌 <b>RULE UPDATES</b><br>\n<b>- Zones</b> are now <b>KOS</b> when a turf is started — no exceptions. <br>\n<b>- Interaction rule:</b> When there is no active war, players must be selling drugs, spraying graffiti, or performing other criminal actions for at least 2 minutes before engaging in combat inside the zone. <br>\n<b>- Once a war is started</b>, it’s free game — kill anyone to gain as many points as possible. <br>\n<b>- Amendment to Max Gang Member Rule:</b> Max members per gang has been reverted to <b>24</b> to encourage more diversity across the server. <br>\n(The gangs over the cap have already been broken up and restructured for the next restart.) <br>\n\n<br>\n<b>BETA PHASE IS OVER</b><br>\nNow that the beta phase is complete, there has been a full <b>turf wipe</b>. All zones are free game once the server is back online.\n",
